        Welcome to my site and I am delighted you are taking time to inform yourself. I wanted this site to be a portal for those that are exploring, and to keep this site more conversational. So, here goes!

        A ‘heart for service’ is what you need to know about me, and this experience matters. This started when I joined the US Marines 5 weeks after I graduated from Appalachian State University. Serving my country is one of the greatest privileges I’ve ever known, both in peacetime and in armed conflict. As soon as I moved to Greensboro I began looking for opportunities to serve. I found that opportunity with the Guilford County GOP (Grand Old Party). I became a Precinct Chairman, helped on campaigns for others, and fundraising. Within a few years I was elected to be the Vice-Chair of the Guilford County Republican Party. During this time I worked with, and for , some of the finest people in our community while helping my wife raise our three children. Since those days I have continued to serve in a variety of ways. Below are a few highlights that may be helpful

        I was elected to the Board of Education as the District 3 representative in 2016 and was re-elected in 2020. I have the distinct pleasure of working on behalf of students and their families to solve problems. Serving on the Board of education in District 3 I have had the honor of leading our CTE (Career Technical Education) efforts, helping secure $3mm from the NC General Assembly to help bolster our signature career academies. These efforts have been broad based, challenging and have involved working with multiple stake-holders, across a wide spectrum of  priorities.
